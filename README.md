* Proficient on 85% of Non-DSA Technical Mastery (TM) standards
* Proficient on 85% of DSA standards
* Proficient on 100% of DSA whiteboarding standards
* Have minimum 2 "portfolio-ready" projects in resumé

## Certifying Technical Interviews


### Overview
Fellows will receive Certification in Technical Interviews by passing a Mock Interview with a “certification volunteer”. Certification Volunteers are a set group of volunteers with technical experience who have been trained to certify Fellows for technical interviewing. Fellows that are at the 85% readiness mark for both non-DSA and DSA, and 100% for whiteboarding are generally considered “ready” for the technical interview certification. Fellows must pass one technical interview (receive proficient or above in every rubric row) with a certification volunteer in order to receive the Certification.

### Scheduling interviews
Fellows will work with Program Managers to schedule interviews. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced whiteboarding with their Instructional team and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  Interviews are available M-Th from 6 PM - 8PM.

### Recording Interviews 
We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. Please keep videos and mock interview questions private for equitability across all Fellows. 

### Rescheduling Interviews
If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

### Recording lateness/no-shows
Check with the Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance. If a Fellow is “Late”, “No Show with Communication”, or “No Show Without Communication", this is considered a potential red flag toward job readiness. 

### Sharing Feedback to Fellows
Fellows will receive feedback within 3 working days of the interview.
For "pass": Fellow will receive qualitative feedback from interviewers in writing via email (not slack). A Fellow may also follow up with the lead instructor in person.
For "needs prctice in key areas": Lead instructor and Fellow will schedule a 20 minute debrief where the Lead Instructor shares a summary of feedback from the interviewer and discuss: 
* How did you think it went? 
* Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
* How will you keep practicing?

### Re-assessing Technical Interviews
After Fellows receive qualitative feedback from the interviewers, they should continue to practice whiteboarding by signing up for Office Hours with the instructional team, before letting their PM know they’d like to schedule another mock technical interview. In order for Fellows to set up a second mock interview, there must be a minimum of one whiteboarding office hours session with the Lead Instructor or an IA and at least one week of independent practice completed.


## Certifying Behavioral Interviews 

### Interview format
Fellows will have 45 minutes for their mock interview with a volunteer. Prepare for this as a real interview, including how you dress, and how you research the company and role. Fellows will be assessed along the updated [link] Behavioral Interview rubric.
 
## Scheduling interviews
Program Managers will sign up Fellows who are ready for mock behavioral interviews every two weeks. Contact the PM via email to confirm the date, time, location and relevant job description for interview. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced Behavioral Interviews with the PM already and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  

## Rescheduling Interviews
If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow needs to reschedule last minute for any reason, they need to contact their Program Manager as soon as possible. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

## Recording lateness/no-shows
Check with the Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance. If a Fellow is “Late”, “No Show with Communication”, or “No Show Without Communication", this is considered a potential red flag toward job readiness. 

## Passing Interviews
To pass the Behavioral Interview, Fellows must:
(1) score proficient or above on the following rubric items:
* Pop Pitch (tell me about yourself)
* Research Company
* Answering Questions - Technical Projects
* Asking Questions 
* Language & Voice
* Confidence
* Professionalism

(2) score proficient or above on at least 4 of the 5 “answering questions with STAR format” questions that focus on leadership, teamwork, growth-mindset/self awareness and solving problems. Fellows can get a ‘developing’ score on 1 of the 5 questions and still pass. 

## Recording Interviews 
We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with PMs for further feedback. Please remind Fellows to keep their videos and mock interview questions private to keep it equitable across all Fellows. 


## Entering Behavioral Interview Scores 
Interviewers are expected to enter rubric scores within 24 hours. Program Managers should look up Fellow scores and enter it into Canvas under the “Behavioral Interview PS.3.c” assignment. 

PMs are responsible for reviewing the rubric responses within 48 hours and flagging for Alexis via Slack or email if the volunteer has not submitted feedback/submitted incomplete feedback. 


## Quality Assurance
All interviewers will have been trained in Pursuit’s rubric and interview structure, however we will also be monitoring volunteer assessments ongoing. If you notice inconsistencies with rubric grading or if you are concerned about the results of a Fellow’s interview, please contact Jessica Shyu. 


## Sharing Feedback to Fellows
Program Managers should let all Fellows know if they passed/failed and share feedback from each interview within 3 working days of the interview based on Fellow scores. 

FOR ALL FELLOWS: Summarize any qualitative feedback from interviewers to share it with Fellows in writing via email (not Slack) using the feedback template, CC’ing Jess, Ben and Arthur so that there is a clear paper trail. 

FOR FELLOWS WHO PASSED: You may follow up in-person optionally

FOR FELLOWS WHO DID NOT PASS: Schedule a 20 minute debrief where the PM shares feedback from the interviewer and discusses: 
How did you think it went? 
Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
How will you keep practicing?


Re-assessing Behavioral Interviews
After Fellows receive qualitative feedback following the interview and debrief, they will need to scheduled at least 1 additional practice round with their PM or another volunteer, and practice independently for a minimum of 1 week.

Volunteer and tech recruiter, Melanie Lahti will be available to support Fellows through her virtual office hours EVERY Thursday. Fellows can sign up here to work with her. They should identify 2 BIQs they need help with and send them to Melanie in the calendly link prior to the meeting. 

Timeliness and Professionalism of Fellows 
Timeliness and professionalism (clothing choice, writing utensils/paper, resume) have been flagged as important by employer partners. The certifying interviews are an opportunity for Fellows to practice professionalism during an end to end experience. 

PMs are responsible for checking in all Fellows for their interviews (or identifying and training a replacement). During the check in, PMs should note the following in the Check in document for all Fellows 

Timeliness 
Appropriate dress (neat and tidy, no suit)
Materials: copy of resume and writing utensil/paper

PMs should provide constructive feedback in a timely manner for any violations of timeliness and professionalism and ensure the Fellow understands the importance of professionalism during the job process.  Timeliness and professionalism violations as outlined above can impact Fellow behavioral interview certification at the discretion of the PM.
