# Job Readiness Guide

All 6.0 Fellows must meet the following technical and professional skills readiness standards in order to be considered for Pursuit-facilitated job opportunities. The Job Readiness Certification is Pursuit’s official stamp that you have mastered the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare for the job search phase and get your first job as a software developer.

## Here are the criteria for a Fellow to be certified as "job-ready":

* Proficient on 85% of Non-DSA Technical Mastery (TM) standards
* Proficient on 85% of DSA standards
* Proficient on 100% of DSA whiteboarding standards
* Have minimum 2 "portfolio-ready" projects in resumé

* Proficient on Resume/LinkedIn rubric
* Proficient on Cover Letter rubric
* Proficient on Technical Interview rubric
* Proficient on Behavioral Interview rubric

## Certifying Technical Interviews


### Overview
Fellows will receive Certification in Technical Interviews by passing a Mock Interview with a “certification volunteer”. Certification Volunteers are a set group of volunteers with technical experience who have been trained to certify Fellows for technical interviewing. Fellows that are at the 85% readiness mark for both non-DSA and DSA, and 100% for whiteboarding are generally considered “ready” for the technical interview certification. Fellows must pass one technical interview (receive proficient or above in every rubric row) with a certification volunteer in order to receive the Certification.

### Scheduling interviews
Fellows will work with Program Managers to schedule interviews. Fellows will be scheduled if they’ve practiced whiteboarding with their Instructional team and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  Interviews are available M-Th from 6 PM - 8PM.

### Recording Interviews 
We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. Please keep videos and mock interview questions private for equitability across all Fellows. 

### Rescheduling Interviews
If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

### Recording lateness/no-shows
Check with your Program Manager (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) to record attendance. If a Fellow is “Late”, “No Show with Communication”, or “No Show Without Communication", this is considered a potential red flag toward job readiness. 

### Sharing Feedback to Fellows
You will receive feedback within 3 working days of the interview.
For "pass": Fellow will receive qualitative feedback from interviewers in writing via email (not slack). A Fellow may also follow up with the lead instructor in person.
For "needs prctice in key areas": Lead instructor and Fellow will schedule a 20 minute debrief where the Lead Instructor shares a summary of feedback from the interviewer and discuss: 
* How did you think it went? 
* Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
* How will you keep practicing?

### Re-assessing Technical Interviews
After Fellows receive qualitative feedback from the interviewers, they should continue to practice whiteboarding by signing up for Office Hours with the instructional team, before letting their PM know they’d like to schedule another mock technical interview. In order for Fellows to set up a second mock interview, there must be a minimum of one whiteboarding office hours session with the Lead Instructor or an IA and at least one week of independent practice completed.
