## Certifying Technical Interviews


### Overview
Fellows will receive Certification in Technical Interviews by passing a Mock Interview with a “certification volunteer”. Certification Volunteers are a set group of volunteers with technical experience who have been trained to certify Fellows for technical interviewing. Fellows that are at the 85% readiness mark in DSA and TM are generally considered “ready” for the technical interview certification. Fellows must pass one technical interview (receive proficient or above in ever rubric row) with a certification volunteer in order to receive the Certification.

Scheduling interviews
Program Managers will sign up and email (template) Fellows who are ready for mock technical interviews every two weeks and will work with their Classroom Team to determine who’s ready. Fellows should not have access to this link. Fellows should only be scheduled if they’ve practiced whiteboarding with their Instructor and have scored “proficient” across the rubric.  Interviews are available M-Th from 6 PM - 8PM.

Recording Interviews 
We highly encourage Fellows to record their whiteboarding interview via Quicktime on their laptops so that they can watch their interview and share it with instructors for further feedback. Please remind Fellows to keep their videos and mock interview questions private to keep it equitable across all Fellows. 

Rescheduling Interviews
If the Fellow is unable to make the scheduled time, they can switch with another Fellow who’s already scheduled up to 48 hours in advance. If a Fellow is a no-show for the interview or reschedules last minute for any reason, they will not be rescheduled for at least two weeks.

Recording lateness/no-shows
Program Managers (or whoever is responsible that day for checking in Fellows to their interviews) must record their attendance in the mock interview sign-up sheet and list whether the Fellow was “On Time”, “Late”, “No Show with Communication” or “No Show Without Communication”. Program Managers should follow up immediately with Fellows who are Late or No-Shows and flag it to their manager. 

Quality Assurance
All interviewers will have been trained in Pursuit’s rubric and interview structure; however we will also be monitoring volunteer assessments on an ongoing basis. If you notice inconsistencies with rubric grading, please contact benstone@pursuit.org. Fellows should share the recording of their interview with their instructor to help us norm around interviewer quality. 

Feedback and Entering Technical Interview Scores
Interviewers are expected to enter rubric scores within 24 hours. IA’s should look up Fellow scores and enter it into Canvas under the “DSA Whiteboarding” assignment. IA’s are responsible for reviewing the rubric responses within 48 hours and flagging for Alexis via Slack or email if the volunteer has not submitted feedback/submitted incomplete feedback.

Sharing Feedback to Fellows
Lead instructor should also review Fellow scores and let each Fellow know if they passed/failed and share feedback from each interview within 3 working days of the interview
For Fellows who passed: Summarize any qualitative feedback from interviewers to share it with Fellows either in writing via email (not slack), CC’ing Jess, Ben and Arthur so that there is a clear paper trail. In addition, you may follow up in-person.
For Fellows who did not pass: Schedule a 20 minute debrief where the Lead Instructor shares a summary of feedback from the interviewer and discuss: 
How did you think it went? 
Where did you struggle? Where did you do well? 
How will you keep practicing?

Re-assessing Technical Interviews
After Fellows receive qualitative feedback from the interviewers, they should continue to practice whiteboarding by signing up for Office Hours with the instructional team, before letting their PM know they’d like to schedule another mock technical interview. In order for Fellows to set up a second mock interview, there must be a minimum of one whiteboarding office hours session with the Lead Instructor or an IA and at least one week of independent practice completed.
